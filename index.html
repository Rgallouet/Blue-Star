          </h1>

          <p>In a time where many suns have already died and birthed, Mankind still endured. grasping to the edge of its own galaxy, nothing ever stopped their expansion, until... one tiny mistake. </p>
          <p> Hoj, Hoj, Hear the story of the lonely shuttle "Echo-42", that made his way to catalog planets and stars, proudly broadcasting to the world his research for thousands of years. His latest findings: a small blue star with a few satelites orbiting it capable of hosting a colony! 'What a beauty', should the people sing! </p>
          <p>Alas, once the news arrived to the local Senate representative, Mr. Papouille, only fire and fury seemed to erupt from his grotesque face: "...What? A freaking blue dwarf star now!? Bloody stupid interns again playing their idle games, you can't trust them to check anything these days!!... What will it be next time, demons and dead unicorns in my garden?!".</p>

          <p> On a turn of fate as simple as that, the peculiar finding was officially removed from the starmap, as, it's true, blue dwarf stars were always but a dream and none where ever encountered. None, until Captain Perghall, a reputable pirate and slave trader jumped on the opportunity to an uncatalog center of operations... </p>

          <p>...And wait! That's weird, where are the castle and stuff.... Oh, Scrap that, wrong script... let me get it back... Just a sec</p>
          <p>...should be around here... Come to think of it, I recall it was about conquering humans and stuff... Wait... *moving papers around...*</p>
          <p>...Ah! Sorry for that! I have it, let me see... Ok so forget all the sci-fi stuff. You're... a kind of vampire. Let's call you a vampire. And there are... humans, bad humans, they want to get back from you what you take from them, pretty obvious, and... oh, you can be someone else than a vampire... sounds like demons to me. So you're a kind of demon... and you are conquering human lands. Got that?  </p>
          <p> ok, that script is shorter, there you go now! Hop, hop, to adventure! </p>

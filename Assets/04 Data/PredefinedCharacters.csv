1;“The Vampire Lord”;”Brilliant mind and defty hands, the vampire lord excels both with ranged and melee weapons as requires his noble education. His mastery of war arts makes him a resilient, well-rounded agile foe in physical conflicts with decent protection against non-physical aggressions. However, true to his Vampyri legacy, he refused to learned how to manipulate the elements as only the treacherous and the week requires a strenght which does not lie in one's arms. Born and bred leader, he leads with caution and values a demon's life over a demon's victory. Live to fight another day!”;7;1;1;3;4;2;3;4;1;9
2;“The Horned Warlock”;”Leader by his noble birth and high eduction, the Horned Warlock treads with powers that transcends human beings and disregard physical weaponery. Very knowledgeable, his unspoken powers can lay vast damage to the unwarry. The warlock is however poorly equiped to stop a blade at close range and even more to wield one. He relies on his demons to handle the physical part of the conflicts. On this aspect, the warlock is ruthless to his demons, and trains them to be the most offensive force at play.”;2;3;1;1;7;3;1;7;6;3
3;“The Half-Blood Hunter”;”Product of the greatest shame, the half-blooded had to keep their distance to the other demons, by fear of their stench contaminating purer souls. As such, no close-combat training were ever tought to them. The half-blood hunter, excels in ranged combat, and can learn a trick or two regarding non-physical abilities. He distrust most demons and tends to rely on his own survival skills to live through the day.“;3;4;6;3;1;4;6;1;4;1
4;“The Judge of Hearts”;”Arbiter of Truth and Justice, the Judge of heart has an undisputed right of life and death on all demons, to apply on his own will with his Rules powers. However, all demons also have the right to defend themselves... The judge of heart is extremely frail on physical aspects, but can set forth tremendous offensive energies to lay chaos on his enemies as well as resist the most terrible non physical attacks. Feared by most demons, the judge makes an overall poor leader.“;9;9;5;2;6;1;4;9;3;2
5;“The Divine Butcher”;”Designed for bloody massacres, the divine butcher uses close-combat dual hand weaponery fueled with energies to bypass any defense. Equally talented in physical and non-physical offense, no enemy can resist him. If it was not enough, his decent physical defense makes the butcher only weak to energy-based attacks. As such, it is feared by most of the rational warlords who sees his disruptive potential. His unemotional profile makes him an average leader.“;6;8;2;1;2;8;5;2;9;4
6;“The Resident Whisper”;”Some ghost stories speak of the resident whisper, the silent wanderer that cuts through memory before cutting through the flesh, roaming battlefields and slaying in impunity. These stories, of a demon that none can remember the face nor the existence after looking way, are ones of the best to frighten little demonys at military classes. No decent adult would of course ever consider that granny talks for real.“;5;7;6;1;8;9;7;5;7;6
7;“The Ancient Architect”;”Discrete, recluse, emotionless, adapt of the obscure ekousiology, the ancient architect has been mocked by many, as no demony has ever seen him embrace violence and destruction. It is said that he is deprived of any of the noble values that makes the demonys the grand military civilisation that they are. Strangely enough, the ancient architect always had someone to vouch for him or protect him in times of need... sometimes, to the extent of giving their life... Mockery turned to suspicion, suspicion to uneasyness. He is one of the oldest of demony to date, and no one has ever seen him bleed still. “;1;5;3;2;5;7;9;3;8;5
8;“The Warden of Vice”;”Big, steardy chunk of rock, which served as a door most of its life. Contrary to what one would expect, the warden can be quite fast and intelligent, but he  surely relies more on his brutal strength and defensive capacities to bend his enemies' will. The warden of vice excels in being a pain in the *bottom* in the battlefield, but is quite vulnerable to non-physical attacks.“;4;6;4;2;3;5;2;8;5;7
9;“The Lost Soul Healer”;”Never trust your first impression: this ankou is actually one of the nicest demony you'd encounter this part of the demon circles. Highly resilient to non-physical aggressions, the lost soul healer focuses on mending his companions injuries and reinforcing their battle skills. His leadership skills makes his subjets sturdy but not very offensive. The longer the battle, the harder it is to prevail from him.“;8;2;3;1;9;6;8;6;2;8
